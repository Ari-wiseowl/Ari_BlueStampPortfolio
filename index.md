## Description
For my main project at Bluestamp, I chose to do the Three-Joint Robotic Arm. I chose it because it seemed an interesting way to show what I will learn here at Bluestamp. To test the servos, I needed to download this code called "Sweep," which makes the servo's arm move left and right in a sweeping motion, just as the name suggests. To download it on my computer, I went to File, then clicked on the Servo code to get code that makes the servo arm sweep. After I finished successfully downloading and implementing the code, I had to write all of the servos to 90° so that all of the servos would turn to the correct direction when I implemented the main code for the entire robot arm. I got the 90° code fromt the portfolio of Cokoino, the maker of the Three-Joint Robotic Arm kit. Proper assembly at this stage is essential for the robot arm to follow controller commands accurately.

### Sweep Code:
```
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create Servo object to control a servo
// twelve Servo objects can be created on most boards

int pos = 0;    // variable to store the servo position

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(10);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the Servo object
}

void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
    // in steps of 1 degree
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15 ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { // goes from 180 degrees to 0 degrees
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15 ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
}
```

### Writing to 90° Code:
```
#include<Servo.h>
Servo myservo1;  // Create a servo class
Servo myservo2;  // Create a servo class
Servo myservo3;  // Create a servo class
Servo myservo4;  // Create a servo class

void setup() {  
myservo1.attach(4);  //Set the servo control pin as D4
myservo2.attach(5);  //Set the servo control pin as D5
myservo3.attach(6);  //Set the servo control pin as D6
myservo4.attach(7);  //Set the servo control pin as D7
delay(100);          //delay 100ms 
}

void loop() {
 myservo1.write(90);  //The servo is 90 degrees
 myservo2.write(90);  //The servo is 90 degrees
 myservo3.write(90);  //The servo is 90 degrees
 myservo4.write(90);  //The servo is 90 degrees
 delay(1000);
 }
```

## Challenges
Because my code could not find the right port for the Arduino app to connect to, I had to restart my computer. Then, my computer could find the non-Bluetooth port that I can successfully use.

## New Steps
For my next milestone, I will finish building my 3-joint robotic arm. To complete my entire project, I will also have to make code for the arm to actually move.

## Description
For my starter project at Bluestamp, I chose the RGB color sliders. Before my experience at Bluestamp, I had never worked with circuits, so I chose the RGB color sliders to learn about circuits and soldering irons. I thought it would be a good idea to familiarize myself with circuits and Arduinos because my final project uses them as well. For my RGB color sliders, I soldered the pieces on using a soldering iron. The way it works is that if you push one of the red, green, and blue sliders, it sends a signal to the LED, resulting in the color of the light changing. Each of the sliders has a small resistor near it to prevent the circuit from short-circuiting.

## Challenges
When I finished soldering everything on my circuit, it was time to start testing my project. Unfortunately, none of the sliders worked, and the LED did not light up. Eventually, I did a multimeter connectivity test to see if all my soldering was perfect. When all of the connections made a buzz, it was then evident that I did not position the LED in the correct orientation. Then, I tried to desolder the joints, but without any luck. I had to redo the entire project, but, fortunately, the second time I made the RGB color sliders, they were fully functional.

## Next Steps
Now that this project is completed, I have a better understanding of circuits, soldering, and LEDs.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
